When you click on the "Send" button, the page makes a POST request to the server (
https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note) of type text/html; charset=utf-8
containing the user's note in the following format

note="user note"

To which the server responds with "302 Found".

Then, it makes a GET request to "https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes" obtaining the json of all the notes, with the new note that the user sent and updates the HTML.
